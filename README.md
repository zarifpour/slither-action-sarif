# üêç slither-action-sarif

This repository showcases the integration of Slither, a static analysis tool for Solidity, with GitHub's Code Scanning feature. It aims to demonstrate the automated detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts using Slither within a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Getting Started
- Review the GitHub Actions setup in this repo to see Slither in action.
- Examine the SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) reports generated by Slither for insights into potential vulnerabilities.
- Detailed integration steps and usage guidelines are available in the [Slither GitHub Action documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither-action?tab=readme-ov-file#github-code-scanning-integration).
